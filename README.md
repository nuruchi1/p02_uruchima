For the second project I had attempted to create an application that would let the user make three different graphs. My original plan was to create a line graph, a bar graph, and a pie chart. Unfortunately I encountered some issues with my laptop that caused me to lose non-commited code, and was unable to get the first of three graphs to work. What can be seen from the screenshots is the starting screen and two of the three screens the user would see after clicking one of the buttons.
